I-- I do better on foot anyway. We also needsome way to make us look official, like we got all the answers.Kip:How about some gold bracelets?Rico:We need, like, some name tags with our picture on it, all laminated and whatnot. Imean, we gotta look legit, man.Kip:That's true. That's true.Rico:Say, you know of a-- a place we can get our picture taken, like, a-- a photo store?-Deb:Okay. Turn your head on more of a slant. Now, make a fist and slowly ease it upunderneath your chin. This is looking really good.Kip:You can say that again.Deb:Okay, hold still right there. Now, just image you're weightless.

I don't even have any good skills.Pedro:What do you mean?Napoleon:You know, like numchuck skills, bow hunting skills, computer hacking skills. Girls onlywant boyfriends who have great skills.Pedro:Aren't you pretty good at drawing, like, animals and warriors and stuff?Napoleon:Yes. Probably the best that I know of.Pedro:Just draw a picture of the girl you want to take out, and give it to her for, like, a gift orsomething.Napoleon:That's a pretty good idea.-Rico:Now, if you invest in the 24-piece set I'm gonna throw in a little gift.Man:So, what's the gift?Rico:I bet you folks don't have one of these.Woman:I want that.Rico:You see, this ain't your run-of-the-mill "crapper-ware." These are some serious"NuPont" fiber-woven bowls.Man:So, if we purchase the 24-piece set...the mini sailboat is included?Rico:That's correct, sir. Lance, you look like a strong young pup. Why don't you see if youcan give that a nice tear. Don't hurt yourself now.Man:I can't do it. Can't.Rico:So, uh...how does the "dealio" sound to you?-Kip:Dang it.-Napoleon:Is Trisha here?Trisha's Mom:Oh, I'm sorry, she's not. She's at a friend's house right now.Rico:Well, hey, Napoleon. Napoleon's my nephew.Trisha's Mom:Oh, that's nice.Napoleon:Could you just give this to her for me?Trisha's Mom:I certainly could.Napoleon:Thanks.Trisha's Mom:Bye-bye.Rico:Poor kid. I've been takin' care of him while his grandma's in the hospital. He still wetsthe bed and everything.Trisha's Mom:You're kidding.Rico:Yeah, he's a tender little guy. He still gets beat up and whatnot. Anyway, uh...so we stillfeelin' pretty good about this, uh, 32-piece set here?-Kip:Ow!Napoleon:What the crap was Uncle Rico doin' over at my girlfriend's house?Kip:Napoleon, let go of me! I think you're bruisin' my neck meat!Napoleon:Fine. What the heck are you guys doin'? Tryin' to ruin my life and make me look like afriggin' idiot?Kip:I'm out makin' some sweet moola with Uncle Rico. Geez, I think you ripped my moleoff.Napoleon:I did?Kip:Yeah, is it bleeding?[Door Opens]Napoleon:A little bit.Rico:Hey, Kip. I wish you wouldn't look at me like that, Napoleon.Napoleon:I wish you'd get out of my life and shut up.Rico:I'm gonna tell you somethin' right now. While you're out there playin' patty-cake withyour friend Pedro, your Uncle Rico... is makin' 120 bucks.Napoleon:I could make that much money in five seconds.Kip:Geez. Yeah, right, Napoleon. I made, like, 75 bucks today.Rico:Napoleon, it looks like you don't have a job. So why don't you get out there and feedTina.Napoleon:Why don't you go eat a "decroded" piece of crap.-Napoleon Dynamite's Voice Reading Letter:There's a lot more where this came from if you go to the dance with me.
